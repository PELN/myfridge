Database exam 2019  
Case: Choose own project to demonstrate how to perform CRUD with own choice of database

Tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL

## Detailed description
For the database exam at first semester I have chosen to develop a web application called ‘My Fridge’, with the
purpose of logging food items with an expiry date, to always keep track of what you have in your fridge.  

The project I have chosen has incorporated all CRUD operations and is implemented with MySQL and PHP.

During the project I have worked with designing and normalizing the database in MySQL. 

## How to use the system
You have to signup and login to save items on your own profile.  

To add an item - click on the 'Add item' tab.   
When you start typing a food item it will suggest some that are already on the list.   
If you type one there is not on the list, you can add a new item.

The item will be added to 'My fridge' tab, where you can see, edit and remove items.
